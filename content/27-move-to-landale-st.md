With three children so close in age and a new business to grow, the busy life was on.

Not long after Mike was born, we bought our first and only home. Our family had outgrown the small Clinton St. apartment and we had enlarged the business and moved it into a building on Ventura Place in Studio City. We found a newly built home on Landale St. and purchased it for the tidy sum of about $25,000. Doesn’t seem possible. The house had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, a living room and dining area, a den, a good-sized covered patio, and a back lawn. Later, we expanded the house and made some major modifications.
