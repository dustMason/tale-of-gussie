College brought awareness of different cultures, learning how to be social, angst about achieving and figuring out my future, and the young adult consternation of not having a guy or even dating,

I attended Willimantic State Teacher’s College for four years on a full scholarship. I stayed at the dorm for 6 months of the year (the cold months). The rest of the time, I hitch-hiked from the farm – about 20 miles.

At college, I was exposed to students from different financial backgrounds, different places, and with different personalities. There wasn’t, however, much racial diversity. I remember one dynamic black woman. That’s all.

In high school I was a loner, but in college I was thrust into groups where I was expected to talk. At the dorm, students congregated in the rec room where you could listen to the radio or the Victrola, play games (like ping pong, checkers, chess), and chat. I would much rather listen than talk but I did eventually get better at mingling. I always sat with my friends: my roommate Virgene (Jean) Sullivan and another young woman named Ann Nahas. Jean, Ann, and I became quite the trio.

Jean was Irish Catholic and once invited me to a church service. The experience was an uncomfortable one – all the kneeling and kissing the cross. Despite religious differences, Jean and I became close. Jean lived in Providence, RI. and sometimes came to the farm. I was ecstatic to have a friend come to visit.

Years later, Joe and I took a trip to visit my niece Sharen and her husband Tom. We took the opportunity to catch up with Ann Nahas in Mansfield, Connecticut. Ann and her husband owned an art store where they carried primarily painting supplies – canvas, oils, acrylics, brushes, etc. At the time of the visit, Ann’s daughters were old enough to begin the process of taking over the business.  Seeing Ann after all those years was interesting. When Ann was young and single – she was lively. But later Ann suffered from diabetes and wasn’t well.

There was one guy in college, Murray, who I was sweet on. He was quite nice and friendly. I hoped Murray would ask me out, but it never happened. Despite that, I was glad to just hang out with him in the rec room. Jean later told me that Murray never asked me out because he thought I had a boyfriend. I didn’t, and never did until I met my future husband, Joe.

I remember taking a Music class. My musical background was nil. I knew nothing about composers or opera. But I passed the course and learned a lot about classical music. Most of which I’ve forgotten.


Another memorable class was the Folk-Dance class. I took to folk dancing like a fish to water. I loved the dances and the twirly skirts. I loved it so much that I joined a folk-dance group my teacher had formed with six or so other students. We were once invited to perform at a community event and managed to dig up folk dancing outfits for the performance.

Being a teacher’s college, many of my classes revolved around teaching methods. How to teach X. Things like how to teach reading, how to teach math, how to teach history.

The final rite of passage at college was student teaching. My first student teaching assignment was a 6th grade special education class. The class was very large, and I had absolutely no experience in this area. I didn’t do well.

My second student teaching assignment was more of a success. The class was a 1st grade class and a perfect fit for me. I had a good time, and the kids had a good time.

After nearly four years of college classes and new experiences, I graduated in April 1943. The final semester was cut short by a couple of months because of the war. Most of the men had enlisted in the military. More women were needed to teach at all levels. My first job after college was in Voluntown as a Kindergarten (morning) and 1st grade teacher (afternoon). I was filling in for a man who left for service.
