Bill has also been a calming influence in my life. He is always willing to share philosophic ideas. He participates in the care of Jake by talking to him every week. That is a great help to me. I can put problems in front of Bill and listen to possible solutions.

When Bill visits me, he does many chores around the house, like cleaning windows, cleaning out the garage, and other tasks. He's always ready to help. Bill is currently enrolled in school to obtain a master's degree. School seems very important to him. I love him dearly and wish him well in his endeavors.
