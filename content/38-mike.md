Mike is the speed demon in the trio. Now you see him and now you don't! He stops in every morning to check on me and with a "how's everything?” he's onto his bike and off to work. He does stop when I ask him a question or need advice, or to work on a project. He loves projects and does them with relish.

On Sunday mornings, when my own orange trees are in between seasons, Mike bikes to the local farmer’s market to purchase a 10 lb. bag of oranges for me. I must have my freshly squeezed glass of orange juice every day.

Mike bought the Kit Kraft business from Joe and I about 25 years ago. Now he is about to close the business and retire. Something he is both anxious about and looking forward to. He is more than ready for retirement, and I know he will find his way into a fulfilling next chapter. I love Mike dearly.
