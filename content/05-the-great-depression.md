I have very dim memories of how this affected my family. I do remember discussions about how some of our customers were not paying up for milk deliveries. We had to make compromises. I know there were shortages of food but being on the farm – we always had milk and butter, we were getting eggs from our chickens, and we had vegetables from our garden. We had a huge bull that my father butchered to sell the meat. Honestly, I’m not sure whether it was done during the Depression or some other time. I also don’t remember if we had a Rabbi come to assure the meat was Kosher so that we could eat some or whether we sold all the meat to the butcher. I think we were lucky though. We never went hungry, and we always had a roof over our heads.
