Ceil was 7 years older than I and we didn't have much in common.

I have an odd memory of Ceil cutting off all her hair to encourage new growth. She must have been in her late teens. Who does that? While her hair was growing back, Ceil decided to embark on a new business. Raising chickens and selling eggs. She ordered a flock of baby chicks and when they arrived, she fed and cared for them. By the time the chicks had grown into a brood of hens and started laying eggs, Ceil’s hair had grown in. Our parents were proud of her – probably for the eggs, not the hair incident. Although the eggs were proliferating, Ceil’s hair didn’t grow back any thicker than it had been.

Ceil met and married Abe Witler in California and they seemed to live happily ever after. They had two sons: Barry and Jerry.
