Jack was the son of my father’s sister Yetta and was several years younger than me. Like Libby, he came to the farm often. I thought him a pest of the first order and usually kept my distance. He usually got entangled with my brothers and it never ended well.

We lost touch after I married and didn’t see each other for years. When we did meet again, what a change! He had married a wonderful woman, Rhoda, and they were a lovely and loving couple.

Jack and I talked about his behavior as a kid. He couldn't believe he had been that bad, but he did understand my feelings about it. We established a new relationship and stayed in touch. I very much enjoyed his company. When Jack died, Joe and I attended his funeral on the East coast. I'll always remember what a fine person he had become and what a joy to be with him.
