Title: Let the Bridge Playing Begin
Weight: 280

Our backdoor neighbors were Lydia and Leonard Levy. Lydia saw me out in the yard not long after we moved in and called over the fence to welcome us to the neighborhood. They invited us over to play bridge. We had not a clue â€“ but they taught us, and we continued playing for the next 70 years. One could say we loved the game.

Lydia also introduced me to my next-door neighbor, Fay Abkins. It just so happened that Fay taught bridge and was willing to teach us bridge strategies and conventions. We were off to a great start.
