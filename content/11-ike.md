Ike was the oldest son and didn’t seem to mind farm life. When he was older, he called himself a gentlemen-farmer. As soon as he could afford one, Ike purchased a Buick to cruise around in. Even after Ike married, he stayed on the farm with his new bride, Marcia Reisman. They remodeled an area on the second story of the farmhouse into an apartment for themselves. But Marcia missed her family so Ike and Marcia finally moved to Norwich to be closer to her family.

When my parents left for California in the late 1940’s, Ike continued to operate the family farm. In the 1960’s, he opened the Preston Dairy Bar and Restaurant. Ike sold the business when Marcia began showing signs of dementia. Marcia had been very active in the business, doing a lot of the cooking. What sticks in my mind is the huge vats of coleslaw she would prepare. They moved to the warmer climate of Florida. Ike and Marcia had three children: Joseph, Barry and Sharen. All born and raised in Connecticut.
