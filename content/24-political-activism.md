In 1946 to 1947, when we were living in the apartment on Ingraham Street, I got involved with Women for Legislative Action (WLA). There were women who lived in the building who were political activists. They invited me to join. I worked my way up the ranks and became chapter president. I was sent to Washington DC to lobby for peace and nuclear disarmament. I attended one of the first civil rights marches. I also journeyed to Sacramento to meet with our State representatives. I stayed involved with the organization for several years.
