Ella has been my mainstay since the death of Joe. She has done tons of ordering groceries, clothing, sundries, you name it, and does it so smoothly that I hardly notice. But I do notice and greatly appreciate it.

Ella and I FaceTime every day, not only talking "business" but exchanging news of the day, news in our lives, new words which she discovers online, asking and answering our many questions about the mechanics of finance which I find myself involved in. When she's on a visit here, she does the many chores that I need done. She often listens to my tales of woe and offers options for helping. In addition to all of that, she expresses love and caring. She is a calming influence for my many ups and downs since the death of Joe and I love her dearly.
