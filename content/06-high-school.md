I hitch-hiked about 5 miles from the farm into Norwich and then caught a bus across town to get to my high school, the Norwich Free Academy. If I missed the bus, I would have to walk across town to the school carrying my heavy load of books. The commute was quite a journey for a teen. When I look back on this time, I see the beginnings of real independence.

You don’t forget teachers who get you interested. My chemistry teacher once gave an assignment to write an essay about crystals. The students were allowed to look at textbook to get ideas. The student who wrote the best essay would get a medal. I won and became the owner of a copper- colored medal. I may still have the medal around somewhere. I loved chemistry, except for the formulas. I loved the way chemicals mixed to form certain elements.

Another notable teacher was my Shakespeare teacher. I was inspired by the way he quoted Shakespeare and always asked the students what they thought the quote meant. Although it was all Greek to me, I could see that this man loved teaching.

Just like in today’s high schools, there were lockers. The 10-minute passing period never seemed long enough to get to my locker, change out my book and rush to the next class.

I was a loner and didn’t hang out with friends in high school. I ate lunch by myself most of the time and didn’t join clubs or sports.  I had to leave school as soon as my last class was done to catch the bus and then hitch-hike home.

Sometimes I ate lunch in the cafeteria at school, so I needed money. My parents kept their household money in a closet. No banks for them.  Coins and small bills were scattered across the floor of the closet. When I asked my mom for money. she went to the closet.
