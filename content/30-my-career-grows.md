Title: My Career Grows and Takes a Turn

In the late 1960’s, I went back to school for a year to get a California teaching credential. I taught elementary school for 10 years, but I really wanted to become a counselor for these young kids. In the mid 1970s, back to school I went again to get my counseling credential.

I got hired by Sterling Hum, who was a school psychologist and coordinator of elementary school counselors for the Los Angeles School District. Sterling later became a good friend and we spent hours on the phone discussing cases.

I was fortunate to land a job as elementary school counselor in the Los Angeles School District as it was the first time the District had counselors at the elementary school level. This was show time for the counselors to demonstrate how important they were in helping children succeed by helping them emotionally and socially. I was constantly transferred between schools (I was THAT good) until finally ending at Brentwood where I tried a group counseling approach for the kids that seemed to work well.

Although I’ve been in good health most of my life, there have been times when things didn’t go so well for my body. In 1978, I had surgery to remove a cancerous bit from my intestinal tract and as a two for one deal, had my appendix removed at same time. I was out of action for 3 weeks, but the school administration was gracious about my absence.

While still working as a counselor, I went back to school yet again to pursue a Marriage and Family Therapist license. In 1982, I got my license and started a private practice and I looked forward to having my first client.

Again, I went back to school to get my EdD (a doctorate in Education). It took a couple of years, a lot of commuting (I had to go to San Diego) and hard work but in 1985 – I did it! Another degree to hang on my wall. I’m pretty sure this is the graduation where I heard my dad cheering for me.

In 1999, I retired from school counseling and my career took another turn. To this day, I have maintained a private marriage and family therapy practice and I intend to continue until Dec 30, 2021, when I will, at long last, hang up my shingle.

Amidst everything else, during this time (from 1991 to 2019), I helped establish and supervise a community counseling center at Temple Beth Hillel. As a volunteer, I mentored the counselors as they helped people who had lost their way. The center closed when the last counselor left.

As you can see, counseling and therapy – helping kids and adults through emotional issues and traumas has been my passion.
